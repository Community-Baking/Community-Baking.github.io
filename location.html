  <h1>Community Baking </h1>
  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>
    The location is UUSGU (the Unitarian Universalist Society of Grafton and Upton) at 3 Grafton Common, Grafton Mass 01519. 
    To enter you can use the door on the right as you face the church, then go straight ahead into the large open room called Fellowship Hall, and find the kitchen on the opposite side of Fellowship Hall. 
    Or use the door on the left as you face the church, and follow a very short hallway to find Fellowship Hall and the doorway to the kitchen.

  </p>

  <h2>Parking Situation</h2>
  <p>
    All of the parking is free, but it can be a little bit tricky.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are spaces in these places:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>In front of 1 Grafton Common</b> These spots are in front of the brick building at 1 Grafton Common, which has a few storefronts including a cafe. These spots are very close to the church but often full. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Spaces on Boulevard Ave</b> Boulevard Ave is behind the church, off of North Street.  These spaces are also very close to the church but are also often full. Additionally, Boulevard Ave is one way, and there's no left turn at the end. So if you go down Boulevard Ave and don't find a spot, it's kind of annoying.  Note that you are welcome to use the two spaces on the left side of Boulevard Ave that are marked as reserved for the church.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Around the common</b> There are almost always available spots around the common, especially near the Congregational Church at 30 Grafton Common.
    </li>
  </ul>
