  <h1>Community Baking </h1>
  <h2>Where the Bread Goes</h2>
  <p>I (Toby DeKara) like to donate our bread to the Worcester community fridges called the WooFridges.  
    I also invite you to donate our bread to any other organization or hungry neighbor, and to eat some yourself. </p>

  <h2> About the WooFridges</h2>
  <p>
    The WooFridges are a mutual aid project that began during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
    There are 4 locations around the city of Worcester that have a fridge and shelving, right on the street.  Their poicy is "Take what you need.  Leave what you can."
    Here is a link to their website: <a href="https://www.woofridge.org/">www.woofridge.org</a>

  <h2> Here are some of my personal thoughts and feelings about the WooFridges, mutual aid and capitalism.</h2>
  <p>
    Nearly every time that I have gone to the WooFridge at 44 Portland Street (near the Main Branch of the Worcester Public Library), I have met other people dropping off food or picking up food, and they are always grateful for our participation. 
    I worked at a food pantry for a few years, and I love food pantries. They do amazing work, and I continue to support them, but there is definitely a better vibe at the WooFridges.  
    At the food pantry, I felt a division between the people running the food pantry and the people using the food pantry: one group of people set the hours, made the rules, chose the foods, and collected personal information, while the other group of people could take it or leave it.
    At the WooFridge, everything seems much more personal, and it feels like this is *our* fridge.  This is *us* feeding *ourselves*, as a community.
    And that idea of us feeding ourselves as a community is very important.  In many times and places, it was obvious to people that we needed to work together to meet the needs of everyone in our community.  
    But capitalism has told us to focus more narrowly, on ourselves and our immediate families.  Capitalism has told us that caring for people beyond our own household is foolish, naive, or even a sign of weakness.  Capitalism has told us that there is scarcity, and we must compete to survive.
    The truth is, that here in Massachusetts, in 2025, we are extremely wealthy.  We live in one of the wealthiest states in our country, in one of the wealthiest countries of our time, in one of the wealthiest times in human history.  We *can* feed ourselves.
    The need in our community is significant. Federal funds for school lunches have been cut.  SNAP cuts are coming.  But we *can* feed ourselves! No one is coming to save us. Let's roll up our sleeves and do it!
