  <h1>Community Baking </h1>
  <h2>Where the Bread Goes</h2>
  <p>
    People at community baking eat some bread, and take some home for themselves and friends and family.
  </p>
  <p>
    That currently accounts for only a small amount of the bread we bake, and we put rest on the shelves at the Worcester community fridges called the WooFridges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the WooFridges to distribute our bread is a natural choice because, just like Community Baking, the WooFridges are oranized around principles of mutual aid, direct action, collectivism and anarchism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the decision of how to distribute our bread is not set in stone, and it can be changed at any time by general consensus.

  <h2> About the WooFridges</h2>
  <p>
    The WooFridges are a mutual aid project that began during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
      </p>
  <p>
    There are 4 locations around the city of Worcester that have a fridge and shelving, right on the street.  Their poicy is "Take what you need.  Leave what you can.
      </p>
  <p>
    Here is a link to their website: <a href="https://www.woofridge.org/">www.woofridge.org</a>

  <p>
    And here is a link to a wonderful documentary about the WooFridges entitled "More Than a Fridge": <a href="https://youtu.be/6_gy70Pb6kM?si=HtoQ7hROQoMKXOaB">More Than a Fridge</a> 
    It was produced by Alex O'Neil, and debuted in Worcester in 2024.
