  <h2>Where the Bread Goes</h2>
  <p>I (Toby DeKara) like to donate our bread to the Worcester community fridges called the WooFridges.  
    I also invite you to donate our bread to any other organization or hungry neighbor, and to eat some yourself. </p>

  <h2> About the WooFridges</h2>

    The WooFridges are a mutual aid project that began during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
    There are 4 locations around the city of Worcester that have a fridge and shelving, right on the street.  Their poicy is "Take what you need.  Leave what you can."
