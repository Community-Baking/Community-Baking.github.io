  <h2>Walk and Talk</h2>

  <h3>A note about this page, from Toby DeKara</h3>
  <p>
    It is important, for those of us engaged in the freedom movement, to "walk and the walk and talk the talk."  I want you to know that for most of my life, I did not understand that.  
    I believed that "actions spoke louder than words," and "talk was cheap," and stuff like that.  
    And so, during the first season of community baking (Feb. - May, 2025), I spent a lot of time doing community baking, and discussing the practical, little day to day things, 
    but I spent very little time talking about the principles that have guided me or the wider context we operate within.  
    This page is an attempt to discuss these important issues.
    You can add a post to this page.  
    If you like, you can simply give me the text of what you want to say and I can post it. 
    Or, if you are tech savy, or at least tech curious, you can become an editor of this website by requesting access to the community-baking repository on github.

  <h3> Toby DeKara - WooFridges, mutual aid and capitalism - August 2025.</h3>
  <p>
    Nearly every time that I have gone to the WooFridge at 44 Portland Street (near the Main Branch of the Worcester Public Library), I have met other people dropping off food or picking up food, and they are always grateful for our participation. 
    I worked at a food pantry for a few years, and I love food pantries. They do amazing work, and I continue to support them, but there is definitely a better vibe at the WooFridges.  
    At the food pantry, I felt a division between the people running the food pantry and the people using the food pantry: one group of people set the hours, made the rules, chose the foods, and collected personal information, while the other group of people could take it or leave it.
    At the WooFridge, everything seems much more personal, and it feels like this is *our* fridge.  This is *us* feeding *ourselves*, as a community.
    And that idea of us feeding ourselves as a community is very important.  At other times and in other places, it has been obvious to people that we needed to work together to meet the needs of everyone in our community.  
    But capitalism has told us to focus more narrowly, on ourselves and our immediate families.  Capitalism has told us that caring for people beyond our own household is foolish, naive, or even a sign of weakness.  Capitalism has told us that there is scarcity, and we must compete to survive.
    The truth is, that here in Massachusetts, in 2025, we are extremely wealthy.  We live in one of the wealthiest states in our country, in one of the wealthiest countries of our time, in one of the wealthiest times in human history.  We *can* feed ourselves.
    The need in our community is significant. Federal funds for school lunches have been cut.  SNAP cuts are coming.  But we *can* feed ourselves! No one is coming to save us. Let's roll up our sleeves and do it!
